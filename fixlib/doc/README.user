1. intro
---------------------------------------------------------------

this README is geared towards the users of fixlib.

fixlib is implemented in Matlab.  Matlab is available on most of the Suns,
SGIs, and PCs.  Older versions of matlab are available on the Mac but the
lab currently does not have such a copy (8.14.01).

2. running matlab
---------------------------------------------------------------

Fixlib was written for Matlab v 6.  Backwards compatibility not guaranteed.

there is a script in the bin directory called run-matlab (for
UNIX/SGI machines) that will start matlab w/o the big desktop GUI or the splash
screen. 

once you start matlab, run setup.m or setup_win.m. this adds the appropriate
paths to matlabs path list.  you might need to tailor this setup to your
particular paths.

http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab.shtml

is the URL for Matlab's "homepage". Its called the Helpdesk and has useful
documents for Matlab users. here you can find tutorials, etc.  You need to
be somewhat competent in Matlab (its part-calculator, part-programming 
language) otherwise you'll probably be miserable using this or any other 
Matlab stuff. Also, knowing Matlab is a useful (if not essential) tool for
general science-y stuff these days.

3. what you can use Fixlib for
---------------------------------------------------------------

the Fixlib code can be roughly divided into generic code, and research-specific
code.  As a user you're probably not initially interested in the generic code;
you probably want to use the specific code.

Each set of research-specific code has its own directory, as follows:

src/bfx				Baufix code
src/cba				Change blindness code ("bricks" expt)
src/stp				Saccade testing program 

check out the README in each of the directories for more info.

There are also some generic things you should know about:

./README.user.fixfinders	using fixlib as "fixation finder"
./README.user.loadingfiles      all about loading files
./README.user.metrics		metrics available for future use
./README.user.viz		visualization available in fixlib
